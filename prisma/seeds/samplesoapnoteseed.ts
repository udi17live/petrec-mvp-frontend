    const summary = "During today's visit, we addressed your dog's recent symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea, which began after she ate a little bit of roast beef. It's possible this could have irritated her pancreas, a condition known as pancreatitis, though she's feeling better now and has started eating again. We conducted a thorough examination, checking for any other underlying issues. Her ears, heart, and lungs are in good condition, though there are signs of dental disease and mild age-related cataracts. Additionally, she exhibits allergies, leading to paw licking and redness in her eyes. We recommend using an eye ointment with a steroid to help manage these symptoms. Also, the fatty lumps on her body are likely harmless lipomas, which you should monitor for any changes.\n\nTo support her comfort, we're administering two injections today: Librella for arthritis pain and Cytopoint for her allergies. Consider performing a senior health panel to get a comprehensive overview, including a pancreatic test, to investigate any potential underlying issues further. Meanwhile, keep an eye out for new lumps or changes in her behavior. If vomiting resumes, x-rays might be considered. Please feel free to contact us if any additional concerns or questions arise.";
